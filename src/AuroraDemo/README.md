# Aurora_Demo

Copied from: https://github.com/mrfaptastic/ESP32-HUB75-MatrixPanel-DMA/blob/master/examples/AuroraDemo

I modified it to work with a 64x64 panel.

From README.md in that repo:

A port of Aurora visualisations
======

Not all of the visualisations have been ported. About 17 of 37 work, or have been included as I think they look best.
