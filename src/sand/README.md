# Sand Matrix

Sand falling, piling, and changing colors over time. Display is output to a 64x64 LED matrix HUB75 panel.

Uses [mrfaptastic's ESP32-HUB75-MatrixPanel-DMA library](https://github.com/mrfaptastic/ESP32-HUB75-MatrixPanel-DMA), as used by [Brian Lough's ESP32 Trinity project](https://github.com/witnessmenow/ESP32-Trinity).

Code ported from my other project: https://github.com/billism1/sand-matrix
